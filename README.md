design neural network model to classify subjects into drug classes depending on their reaction's profile:

1. Download FAERS data as required.
2. Run append_input_files.py
3. Run drug_and_ae.py
4. To unpickle preprocessed data and to analyse data using neural network, launch Untitled.ipynb in a jupyter notebook.
